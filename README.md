# Neural_Nets_Demystifyed

Demystifying Neural Nets by building it with python(NumPy and SciPy)

## Contents
 
* HyperParameters
* Parameters

* Activation Function  __The one which fires the Neuron__

* Forward Propagation  __Propagating our inputs through the network__

* Gradient Descent     __Estimating the Error and deciding which way to move to rectify the errors__

* Backward Propagation __Learning our parameters__

* Overfitting, Testing and Regularization __So that our network works well for unseen input too__
